<p>Local Vicinity is an application that displays various nearby locations to
the user and allows them to find directions to them. This app will allow users to find locations
based on their current or simulated positions and also add locations to the application for other
users. The goal of this app is to provide information to users that cannot be found with some
other mapping services by allowing users to input locations themselves (with moderator approval).
Locations like public restrooms and university resources can be difficult to find and I plan to map
them out in addition to other more easily accessible attractions. I will use the State College area
as my test case, but the application will be able to expand to new markets easily with user input
of new locations. This app is my project for IST 361 - Application Development Design Studio II at Penn State.</p>

<a id="inspiration" class="anchor" href="#inspiration" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Inspiration</h3>

<p>Last year I took place in a campus-wide bathroom usage competition.  As a result of that I have used the bathroom in over 100 different campus buildings.  While doing this, it became evident that there is no easily accessible database of bathrooms (or lots of other kinds of attractions).  This led me to create this application in an attempt to solve this issue and let the people who are on the ground visiting places everyday contribute their own knowledge to the greater good.</p>
